# Todo

* Remove "Show Names" option, should always be true
* Add "Class-color" option, should default to true but allow disabling class-specific healthbar coloring
* Add a background color to all bars, in a slightly more dimmed color (and change with actual bar color)
* Paladin Beacon of Light is a buff without expiration - render these properly
* Sometimes the button GCD overlay would not show

# Features

* Small main frame hover buttons for lock/unlock and options
* Auto-activate profiles (player-based, for party & spec)
* Allow easier preview of multiple playerframes during configuration
* Add some mythic helpers (affixes, debuffs, ...?)
* Support it-IT and pt-PT locales
