Rewatch is an addon to help you monitor your healing-over-time (HoT) spells as a druid. There's an easy main window which you can move around, which will contain six bars for every target; a healthbar, energy-/rage-/manabar, `Lifebloom` bar, `Rejuvenation` bar, `Regrowth` bar and a `Wild Growth` bar. Simply click a spell bar to cast that spell on that specific player and watch the clicked bar channel down as the corresponding HoT spell runs out.

Party- and raidhealing has never been so easy!
