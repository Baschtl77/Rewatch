# Rewatch
Rewatch is an addon to help you monitor your healing-over-time (HoT) spells as a druid and shaman. There's an easy main window which you can move around, which will contain six bars for every target; a healthbar, energy-/rage-/manabar, lifebloom bar, rejuvenation bar, regrowth bar and a wild growth bar. Simply click a spell bar to cast that spell on that specific player and watch the clicked bar channel down as the corresponding HoT spell runs out.

Party- and raidhealing has never been so easy!
