Nice and minimalistic unit frames addon with action bar features. Shows a clickable spell bar on units for every HoT you got, which channels down as the HoT runs out. Can be configured to your style and can additionally show buttons, support click macros, and show debuffs.

ðŸ’¡ For the best experience, use either [Clique](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/clique) or mouse-over macros ([here](https://www.dvorakgaming.com/warcraft/class-guides/macros/) and [here](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Making_a_macro) )
ðŸ˜Ž Originally a druid-only addon, now open for all!
